# Unemployment-Survey-Breakdown
This repo consists of datasets used to analyze unemployment on different areas in relation to education and age

# Problem Statement

### What demographic and regional factors contribute most to unemployment, and how do age, gender, and education levels influence annual income and unemployment rates across different regions?

# ðŸ“Š Insights from the Dashboard
1. Overall Demographics

Average Age: 44.93 years

Average Income: $10.18M (total, not per individual â€” likely aggregate income of respondents)

Unemployment Rate: 0.26 (26%)

2. Unemployment by Age and Education

Individuals aged 20â€“30 show higher unemployment rates compared to older age groups.

Those with only high school education or incomplete tertiary education are more likely to be unemployed.

Higher education correlates with lower unemployment rates, suggesting education level significantly impacts employment likelihood.

3. Unemployment by Gender and Age

Across most age ranges:

Males exhibit slightly higher unemployment than females between 30â€“50 years.

Females under 30 show higher unemployment than males of the same age â€” possibly due to early career entry or childcare responsibilities.

Older age groups (50â€“60) show declining unemployment for both genders, indicating greater job stability.

4. Regional Breakdown

Highest unemployment regions appear to be:

Pacific and West South Central regions (largest blocks on the treemap).

Lowest unemployment regions include:

New England and East North Central.

This suggests that regional economic conditions and industry presence (e.g., technology vs. manufacturing) heavily influence employment.

5. Income Insights

Annual income (including social welfare) increases with age, peaking around 50â€“60 years.

The average annual income rises consistently with age, indicating career progression or higher benefits for older populations.

There is a gender income gap â€” females (average age 37.43) earn slightly more in total income from welfare programs compared to males (average age 33.33), likely due to higher welfare participation rates.

## Key Takeaways

Younger adults (20â€“30) and those with lower education levels are most vulnerable to unemployment.

Gender differences in unemployment are age-dependent: younger women and middle-aged men face the greatest challenges.

Regional disparities suggest targeted employment policies could reduce unemployment in high-impact zones like the Pacific and West South Central regions.

Income stability improves with age and education, but reliance on social welfare programs is still notable across all demographics.
